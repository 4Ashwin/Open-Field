# OpenField - HACK4TKM
The problem addressed by OpenField is the lack of transparency and accountability in the agricultural supply chain, particularly in the context of harmful substances such as pesticides. The initiative responds to the historical issues associated with the misuse of pesticides which has had severe health and environmental consequences. 
The goal of OpenField is to provide a solution that enables the tracking of agricultural inputs, discourages the use of harmful substances, and promotes responsible farming practices. This is indeed a relevant problem in agriculture, as ensuring the safety of food production and promoting sustainable practices are critical concerns for both the industry and consumers.
Farmers gain the ability to showcase their commitment to responsible practices, access fair pricing, and receive valuable educational resources. Retailers and consumers alike can source products cultivated with care, ensuring their safety and quality while contributing to a sustainable future. Governments and regulatory bodies gain insightful data to inform policy, enforce regulations, and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

## How it Works ?
OpenField leverages existing government apps like eNam to create a tracking system for agricultural inputs, particularly pesticides. Here are the key steps:

Registration: Farmers, retailers, and producers register on the OpenField app.
Purchase and Sale:
- Retailers: Purchase pesticides from producers through the app.
- Farmers: Buy pesticides from retailers and it has to be added to the app.
- Verification: At each purchase, a unique OTP verifies the transaction, ensuring the right farmer receives the right product.
- Product Sale: Farmers sell their products through the app, at mandis(markets), or other approved channels.
- Traceability: A map displays the entire supply chain, showing primary, secondary, and tertiary producers/detailers for each product.
- Issue Tracking: If a problem arises, the map helps identify the source point for investigation and corrective action.
